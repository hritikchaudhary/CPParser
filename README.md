# CPParser
Only Codeforces & Codechef are supported as of now I'll be adding support for other sites soon, please create an issue if you want to request support for a site.

This ST4 plugin functions as follows:

1. Accepts a problem URL like https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1900/D.
2. Parses the URL to extract the problem code.
3. Generates a new .cpp file using a predefined template.
4. Parses testcases on Codeforces & Codechef in CPPFastOlympicCoding format, so if you're using CPPFastOlympicCoding testcases will be automatically added.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

For all operating systems, pressing ctrl+alt+x opens a dialogue box prompting for the problem URL.

### How to Utilize

Upon installation, configuring settings (such as defining the default directory and snippets) is necessary.

Once settings are configured, using ctrl+alt+x opens a dialogue box for entering the problem URL.
